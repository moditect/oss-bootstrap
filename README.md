# OSS Quickstart

Apache Maven archetypes for bootstrapping new open-source projects.

Think [Maven Quickstart Archetype](https://maven.apache.org/archetypes/maven-archetype-quickstart/) and friends, but more modern, complete, and opinionated.

## Features

The archetypes aim add providing commonly used functionality, while defining sensible defaults, following modern conventions and best practices:

* Up-to-date (and fixed) dependency and plug-in versions
* Provide a license
* Basic set-up for CI
* House-keeping and quality assurance plug-ins, e.g. for formatting and license header checking

## Components

* _oss-quickstart-archetype-simple_: A Maven archetype for creating a single module project following best practices
* _oss-quickstart-template-simple_: A template for the single module archetype

## License

This code base is available under the Apache License, version 2.
